Choose independently two numbers B and C at random from the interval [0, 1] with uniform density. Prove that B and C are proper probability distributions.
Note that the point (B,C) is then chosen at random in the unit square.


Using the uniform ditribution function - runif to allocate random numbers
```{r}
set.seed(123)
B <- runif(10000, min = 0, max = 1)
set.seed(234)
C <- runif(10000, min = 0, max = 1)
```


Find the probability that

(a) B + C < 1/2.
```{r}
sum((B + C) < 0.5) / 10000
```

(b) BC < 1/2
```{r}
sum((B*C) < 0.5) / 10000
```

(c) |B ??? C| < 1/2
```{r}
sum(abs(B-C) < 0.5) / 10000
```

(d) max{B,C} < 1/2
```{r}
sum(pmax(B,C) < 0.5) / 10000
```

(e) min{B,C} < 1/2
```{r}
sum(pmin(B,C) < 0.5) / 10000
```
